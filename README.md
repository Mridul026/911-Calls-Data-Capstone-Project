# 911 Calls - Capstone Project
The dataset contains the 911 emergency calls which made throughout the time of year with reasons and addresses from where the incidents happened in different part of USA locations. The dataset used for data analysis and visualization of the reports based on different sceneraions and use cases.

The project is developed on Jupyter Notebook using python libraries Numpy, Pandas with Matplotlib and Seaborn data visualization libraries.


## Steps

### Data and Setup
In this part we invoke the libraries we are going to be using:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Basic Questions
We inspect basic information from the dataset, and we start answering basic question to understand the numbers behind the interesting fields.

### Creating new features
In this part we build a new feature from an existing one, and we play with time format, converting dates in string into DateTime Objects.

### Visualization
For visualization we use from plots, countplots to heatmap and clustermaps to understand the 911 events.

### Extras
Interesting things related data manipulation in this projects are:

- reset_index() 
- unstack()
